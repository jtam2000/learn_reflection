# Macro action items for this project, not cover within the code

09/10/2020:
TODO:1. In the Reflection Project: create methods
    -invokeStaticMethodByName(Class<?> inputClass, String methodName, methodParameters);
    -invokeMethodByName(Class<?> inputClass, String methodName, methodParameters)

TODO:2. learn to use The MethodHandle api to do reflection, continue to update this project
    to introduce a MethodHandle module to create functions that demo the MethodHandle API and write tests to show
    that I understand what is required and what they do
    for example: how to create a MethodHandl  e for a Field, Method and for Constructors
    and the how to invoke Methods or change fields using the Lookup object
    This is follow the PluralSight Course: Java Fundamentals : the Java Reflection API method Handles


TODO:3. Update the Learn JDBC Project to do Dependency Injection by using Reflection API.
    here you want to create @Inject and @Provider Annotation on a JDBC Connection so that the main class does not
    have a hardcoded database dependency on a Specific Database Connection like MYSql,
     you want to demo that you can Switch from MySql
    to H2 without affecting the functionality of the application. So you need to write a H2Provider and MySqlProvider
    and a Coordinator/Manager class that finds the a DB provider and inject the main application with the parameterized
    dbProvider

what is synthetic methods and bridge methods  in java:
https://www.baeldung.com/java-synthetic
    anything introduced by javac that does not have any actual user provided code:

    "Any constructs introduced by a Java compiler that do not have a corresponding construct
    in the source code must be marked as synthetic, except for default constructors,
    the class initialization method, and the values and valueOf methods of the Enum class."

what is native keyword> :  code that is native in another non-java language (like c++)
